Regionally, the gap in mortgage approval rates for all loan purposes between groups based on sex, ethnicity, and race each declined between 8% and 10% from 2007 to 2023, except for the Asian-to-white gap, which decreased from a gap of about 2% to a gap of just 1%. Black applicants have an overall 17.1% lower loan origination rate than white applicants. This is the main reason behind the region’s high white to non-white gap of 11.9%.

Gaps generally narrowed within the region. Female-to-male gaps declined from around 10% in 2007 to around 2% or less in 2023 for Philadelphia and its Pennsylvania suburban counties. In the region’s New Jersey counties, females had loan origination rates approved 0.6% more often than males in 2023. In 2023, Philadelphia had the highest gap between Black and white loan seekers at 21%. However, this gap was also wide and increasing for Pennsylvania suburban counties and New Jersey counties in 2023 at 17.2% and 10.8%, respectively.

Gaps between groups vary by loan purpose. As seen in the second chart, home purchase loans tend to have the highest percentage of originations for all groups, with 2023 rates between 82.5% (Black) and 91.5% (white). Refinancing had the next-highest rates for all groups, While home improvement loans had the lowest approval rates, and the gaps between groups were much wider. Historically, male, non-Latinx, and white populations have had a higher probability of benefiting from the accumulation of generational wealth and income opportunities from homeownership, which shapes the outcomes of present-day mortgage applications.

The third chart shows the levels of total decisioned applications. The years immediately following the Great Recession saw a decrease in approved mortgage applications, followed by a significant uptick from 2018 to 2021 for all loan purposes, followed by another decline after 2021. Record low interest rates during the COVID-19 pandemic are reflected in the rise in refinance applications in 2020 and 2021. Conversely, interest rate jumps in 2022 contributed to a precipitous decline. Generally, they fell in line with 2017 levels. For all decisioned applications between 2018 and 2021, the two groups with the greatest increase were non-Latinx and white populations. Despite total declines after 2021, these two groups continued to engage in loan application activity significantly more than other groups.
