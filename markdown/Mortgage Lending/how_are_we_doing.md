The gap in mortgage approval rates for all loan purposes between groups based on sex, ethnicity, and race all declined by 9% to 10% from 2007 to 2021. The female-to-male loan origination rate gap narrowed from 10.9% in 2007 to 1.4% in 2021, the Latinx-to-non-Latinx gap dropped from 16.8% to 7.4%, and the non-white-to-white gap dropped from 20.5% to 10.2%  in those same years. Asians saw a consistent, but small gap from white loan origination rates with a 1.7% gap in 2007 and 1.6% gap in 2021. Driving the still-high 10.2% non-white to white gap was Black applicants, whose loan origination rates were 15.9% higher than whites’.

Within the region, gaps generally narrowed for all groups. Female-to-male gaps declined from around 10% in 2007 to around 1% in 2021 for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania suburban counties within the region, and New Jersey counties within the region. The Latinx-to-non-Latinx loan origination gap dropped to under 6% by 2021 for Philadelphia County and New Jersey Counties, but was around 8% for Pennsylvania suburban counties. By 2021, Philadelphia had the highest gap between Black and white loan seekers, at 19%. However, this gap was also wide for Pennsylvania suburban counties and New Jersey counties in 2021 at 13% and 10.7%, respectively.

Gaps between groups appear to vary by loan purpose. As seen in the second chart, home purchase loans tend to have the highest percentage of originations for all groups, with origination rates of 84.3% (Black) to 93.7% (white) in 2021. Refinancing had the next-highest rates for all groups, ranging from 75% (Black) to 87% (white) in 2021. Home improvement loans had the lowest approval rates, and the gaps between groups were much wider. In 2021, whites in the region had a home improvement loan origination rate of 71.5%, while Black approval rates were only 41.8%. Origination rate gaps for home improvements in 2021 were greater than 5% for female-to-male; greater than 25% for Latinx-to-non-Latinx, greater than 15% for Asian-to-white; and 30% for Black-to-white. Home improvement loans are often taken out while the recipient continues to pay off their mortgage loan. Historically, male, non-Latinx and white populations have had a higher probability of benefiting from the accumulation of generational wealth and income opportunities, which have shaped the outcomes of mortgage applications.

The third chart shows the levels of total _decisioned applications_. The years immediately following the Great Recession show a decrease in approved mortgage applications, and are followed by a significant uptick in 2018 and onward for all loan purposes. Record low interest rates during the COVID-19 pandemic are reflected in the rise in refinance applications in 2020 and 2021. For all decisioned applications between 2018 and 2021, the two groups’ trend lines that had a precipitous rise were non-Latinx and white populations.
