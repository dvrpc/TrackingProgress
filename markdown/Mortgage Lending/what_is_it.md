Mortgage lending information comes from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's (FFIEC) Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data. _Tracking Progress_ includes data on _loan originations_: the creation of a loan after bank approval. Loan origination rates are calculated from the number of loan applications that were either approved or denied—what is termed as _decisioned applications_ in the third chart. For all charts, the loan’s purpose can be selected via a dropdown list. Trends are displayed by default. Loans for home purchase, home improvement, or refinancing can also be selected.

The gaps in loan origination rate trends by sex, ethnicity, and race are shown in the first chart. By default, trendlines of female-to-male gap, Latinx to non-Latinx gap, and non-white to white gap are shown. To view trendlines of component non-white groups, select Asian to white, or Black to white. 

_Latinx_ represents loan recipients identifying as Hispanic or Latino. Racial groups are presented as _non-white_ and _white _groups, respectively, and contain both Latinx and non-Latinx populations. Races included as non-white are Black, Asian, and populations that were too small to show individual trends, like American Indian and Alaska natives or Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders.

HMDA data limits sex to a binary scale. Choices to survey respondents are limited to male, female, or to leave the information blank. The binary choice in the survey does not capture data specific to intersex and trans individuals; those who identify with a different gender (transgender); or persons who are gender non-conforming, genderqueer, gender fluid, or non-binary. Since the data refers to sex, the same term is used, knowing it has limits. The term sex is also in line with the protections against discrimination based on sex found in the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973—a law DVRPC must comply with as a public agency receiving federal funds.

Each group’s loan origination rates are shown in the second chart.

Total _decisioned applications_  for each year are shown in the final chart. HMDA data tracks eight actions taken at various points within a loan application process. They are:

1. Loan originated
2. Application approved but not accepted
3. Application denied by financial institution
4. Application withdrawn by applicant
5. File closed for incompleteness
6. Loan purchased by your institution
7. Preapproval request denied by financial institution
8. Preapproval request approved but not accepted (optional reporting)

Decisioned applications deal with the final decision made by banks on full applications (numbers 1 and 3 in the list above). Decisioned applications trends show the volume of attempted loan activity occurring within each group.
