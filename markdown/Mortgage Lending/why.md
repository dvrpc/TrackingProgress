Homeownership remains a key mechanism for households to gain wealth and pass it onto their children. Prior to 1974, women without a husband to co-sign on a mortgage could either be denied or given higher interest rates on their bank loans. For decades, opportunities for generational wealth building have been systematically denied on the basis of race and ethnicity. While the practice of redlining is no longer legal, racial, ethnic, and geographic disparities in mortgage lending persist in mortgage lending. Equitable access to loans is critical to the economic vitality, as well as the resiliency of the Greater Philadelphia region and its residents.
