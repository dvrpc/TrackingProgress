Commute mode is tracked by the American Community Survey (ACS) by asking respondents to provide the means of transportation usually used to travel the longest distance to work the prior week. A follow-up question asks about vehicle occupancy when "car, truck, van" is selected. This indicator tracks the sum of all individuals not selecting "car, truck, van" with one person in it. Transportation professionals often group travel modes into "single-occupancy vehicles" (SOV) and "non-single-occupancy vehicles" (non-SOV) because SOVs are a less efficient use of roadway and environmental resources.

The first chart compares the share of workers who drive alone to workers using other means. The second chart examines trends within the modes and submodes of the "Other Means" generalized in the first chart. Toggle the point of origin drop down to get trends of workers that live in the region (residence) and those that work in the region (workplace). Although "worked from home" is not a means of transportation, it is an increasingly important option that lets people opt-out of driving.

Starting with the 2019 data release, the Census Bureau updated means of transportation categories with slight changes in language in the survey form. The following are the changes made, which could have some impact on comparing pre-2019 modes to 2019 or later, though it is likely insignificant. 

* "Bus or trolley bus" became "Bus"
* "Subway or elevated" became "Subway or elevated rail" (_Tracking Progress_ uses "Subway" for this)
* "Railroad" became "Long-distance train or commuter rail" (_Tracking Progress_ uses "Rail" for this)
* "Streetcar or trolley car" became "Light rail, streetcar, or trolley" (_Tracking Progress_ uses "Trolley or Light Rail" for this)

Due to survey sample size, the commute mode shares displayed are estimates—each within a margin of error. Estimates may show a general trend but may not be statistically significant when comparing to each other if change is slight—particularly in lower-population geographies.

_Note: The Census Bureau issued [a statement acknowledging errors in 2017 ACS data for Philadelphia County](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/errata/121.html). Philadelphia estimates for geography of residence are omitted as a result, but the error may impact regional aggregations. Also note, the 2020  1yr ACS was not released due to disruptions of the Covid-19 pandemic._
