From 2006 to 2017, commuters _living_ in the region have increasingly used alternative options relative to driving alone to work—the non-SOV commute share has increased by 1.5%. Commuters _working_ in the region have seen their non-SOV share increase by only 0.9% in the same period. For both the region's residents and workers, the SOV share is very high (71.7 and 72.3%, respectively) with a near-flat—albeit downward—trend.

The second chart shows what is driving the slight increase in non-SOV travel during this period. Public transit and carpool usage continue to be the greatest contributors to non-SOV commutes of the region's residents. Carpooling has steadily declined from 9.0% in 2006 to 7.6% in 2017. Public transit gained in share from 9.4% in 2006 to a peak of 10.6% in 2013, before falling back to 9.6% in 2017. This increase has chiefly been supported by a growing use of commuter rail and subways, but risks future decline if bus ridership continues its steep drop seen in recent years. Regionally, walking commuters have remained steady at just under 4%. Telecommuters have had the greatest increase in non-SOV modeshare in the last 11 years, going from 3.2% to 5.4%. Those that worked from home have surpassed those walking and have become the third highest contributor to non-SOV mode share—after carpooling and public transit. That increase is expected to continue as technology advances, workplace policies become more flexible, and more individuals opt to work for themselves. Bike commuting still registers under 1% in the region but has doubled since 2006.
