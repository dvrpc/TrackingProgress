From 2006 to 2022, commuters _living_ in the region have increasingly used alternative options relative to driving alone to work—the non-SOV commute share has increased by 11.2%. Commuters _working_ in the region have seen their non-SOV share increase by 11.1% in the same period. While the region had been on an upward trend for non-SOV use, progress was slow prior to the COVID-19 Pandemic. No 2020 1-year ACS data for commute mode was reported due to the pandemic, but 2022 showed an unprecedented drop of more than 10% from 2019 levels. This was largely due to the 13% gain in ‘Worked from Home’ over those three years, with telecommuting representing nearly a fifth of all commutes in 2022. However, ‘Drove Alone’ represents 62% of commutes, meaning a lot of single-occupancy vehicles (SOV) are still on the road and it’s hard to project where the telework trend will go in 2023 and beyond.

The second chart shows trends in modes that contribute to non-SOV totals. From 2021 to 2022, ‘Worked from Home’ declined from 24.1% to 19.0% as more workers returned to work post-pandemic. As a result of this decline, all other modes saw slight bumps in their commute mode share: 2.4% increase for driving alone, 1.1% for transit (all modes), 0.5% for walking, 0.3% for biking, and 0.2% for taxi. Only ‘Other Means’ and ‘Motorcycle’ remained unchanged from 2021. The recent growth in taxi commuters and ‘Other Means’ increasing by 0.5% between 2019 and 2021 could indicate a rise in ride-hailing services.
