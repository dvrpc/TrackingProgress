Business formations in the Greater Philadelphia region were up 143% from 2005 levels in 2021.  2020 and 2021 saw successive record-breaking business formations with annual applications 66% higher in 2021 than 2019, which itself was a strong year compared to those preceding it. Annual business formations hadn’t achieved pre-Great Recession-levels until 2015 and was on a steadily upward trend to 2019 before the unprecedented growth stemming from economic shifts in the Covid pandemic.

Relative to the first year business formations were reported, 2005, it’s clear that Philadelphia has led the recent business application trend with 2021 applications at 350% of 2005. Its annual totals went from levels lower than all four New Jersey counties combined in 2014 to surpassing the suburban Pennsylvania counties totals in 2020. The only other county exceeding the regional percentage change since 2005 in 2020 and 2021 was Delaware County.

While the recent trends point to potential health, and certainly resiliency, in the face of the economic headwinds of the pandemic, time will tell how lasting the shifts become.
