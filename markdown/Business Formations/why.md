Business formations are an important indicator of the resilience and entrepreneurial spirit of the local economy. Uncertain times present opportunities and necessitate adaptation to changing economic conditions. New businesses create jobs that shape the prosperity of households and the region at large. The Connections 2050 plan seeks to foster innovation and a highly-skilled workforce, expand entrepreneurialism, encourage new business formation and growth, and support key economic sectors; and business formation statistics help quantify where we stand in achieving that goal.
