Business formations are an important indicator of the resilience and entrepreneurial spirit of the local economy. Uncertain times present opportunities and necessity to adapt to changing economic conditions. New businesses create jobs that shape the prosperity of households and the region at large. The Connections 2050 plan seeks to foster a high-skilled workforce, expand entrepreneurialism, innovation, new business formation and growth, and support key economic sectors, and business formation statistics where we stand in achieving that goal.
