In 2023, there were more than 92,200 business formations in Greater Philadelphia. This continues the strong growth in new businesses that started in 2015 before taking off during the Covid-19 pandemic, although the current year is slightly below the 2021 peak with more 105,800 business formations. The five-year average for new business applications from 2019-23 was 95% higher than from 2005-09. Philadelphia has led the way in business applications, with Montgomery County being the next best performer. 

Unlike the Great Recession, the pandemic recession appears to have accelerated the pre-pandemic trend in more new business formations. This may point to a real shift in economic adaptability, and could be partly spurred by the increased options for business operations brought on by the broader adoption of remote work. [A study](https://www.nber.org/papers/w28912) found that startups in recent years tend to be personal businesses, rather than companies employing multiple workers. It also points out the Great Recession was marked by poor access to credit, with adverse effects on small business lending. This was much less of an issue during the pandemic recession, and supported the large rise in business applications.
