All residents deserve the opportunity to participate and thrive in our economy and their communities, but too often the opportunities available fall short of supporting all individuals and families. Without an inclusive economy, economic growth remains out of reach. [Studies](https://gsdrc.org/document-library/causes-and-consequences-of-income-inequality-a-global-perspective/) show that when the top 20% of earners increase incomes by 1%, gross domestic product (GDP) falls, but if the bottom 20% receives a 1% gain in income, GDP increases. When neighborhoods diversify in income levels, significant gains are seen in essential resources like public education, parks and open space, and infrastructure; and children see new opportunities that they might not have if they were growing up in more income-segregated spaces.
