The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis’ Total Full-Time and Part-Time Employment data provides one of the most comprehensive, publicly available accountings of average annual employment. Beyond full- and part-time employment types, it includes farm employment and other sectors that aren’t always included in other sources, such as Public Administration (with more detail of federal than state and local employment in this category). It also includes and distinguishes both _Wage and Salary_ employees from _Proprietors_ who own their own unincorporated businesses and handle taxation chiefly as personal income. Proprietors tend to be single-person or small businesses and can include construction or repair workers, babysitters, ride-share drivers, artists, local grocers, housekeepers, various freelancers and consultants, and some attorneys and doctors. 

The first chart shows the annual growth rate and the overall growth rate since 2001, along with total employees, wage and salary workers, and proprietors. The second shows the percentage of the region's jobs located in each county. The third chart shows the percentage of jobs that occur in various sectors of the region's economy.
