The job growth rate in the Greater Philadelphia region has been positive for all but three of the twenty years between 2001 and 2021. Two years of losses occurred: in 2009, with a 2.3% decline at the outset of the Great Recession, and in 2020 with the steeper loss of 4.3% when Covid-19 brought the world to a halt. The third year was 2010, when job growth remained flat at 0% at the start of the long recovery out of the Great Recession.  It would take three more years for the total jobs to surpass 2008 levels (as shown in the cumulative trendline with the Since Base Year value type selected). Much of the 2020 losses were recovered in a year’s time. By 2021, the number of jobs in the region had increased by 18% relative to 2001. Only 2018 (18.5%) and 2019 (19.3%) showed more growth from the same base year. The region underperformed relative to national job growth from 2001–2021  (21.5%), but outperformed Pennsylvania (10.2%), New Jersey (15.9%), and the Mid-Atlantic region in general (15.2%).

Proprietorships make up a small fraction of total regional employment but have seen a lot of gains, while Wage and Salary jobs have only seen modest growth. Proprietorship employment grew 97% over 20 years, while Wage and Salary employment grew 6%. As a result, the share of regional employment from Proprietorships went from 13% in 2001 to 22% in 2021. While Proprietorship growth rates were significant in every county, regional employment of this type was largely driven by the 208% growth of Proprietorship employment in Philadelphia. This growth can indicate a rise in entrepreneurial activity and jobs adapting to changing winds in the economy.

While job growth was rather evenly distributed throughout the region's nine counties, two counties have an outsized share of the region’s employment. Almost 45% of all jobs in the region were in Philadelphia (25%) and Montgomery (19%) counties in 2021.

Among the 15 sector groupings shown in the third chart, Health Care and Social Services had the largest share of employment from 2001 to 2021 and had the second largest share increase (2.7%) between those years. Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate had the largest increase in job share (3.0%) and went from fourth to second place among these sectors’ job totals. With steady significant gains starting in 2015, the Transportation, Warehousing, and Utilities sector gained 2.6% and jumped ahead of the greatest number of sectors in the rankings, going from 12th to 7th place. The largest decrease in employment sectors was Manufacturing (3.8%) dropping it from 5th to 10th place in rankings. Retail Trade and State and Local Public Administration each lost about 2% share in the regional sectoral makeup.
