The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) provides a quarterly count of employment and wages as reported by employers and covers more than 95% of U.S. jobs available. County Business Patterns (CBP) is an annual program of the U.S. Census Bureau that provides economic data by industry at the county level. The CBP data is extracted from the Business Register, a database of all known single and multi-establishment employer companies maintained and updated by the U.S. Census Bureau.

The first chart shows the annual growth rate and the overall growth rate since 2001. The second shows the percentage of the region's jobs located in each county. The third chart shows the percentage of jobs that occur in various sectors of the region's economy. The first and second chart are based on QCEW data, and the third chart is based on CBP data.
