For more information on transportation system performance and strategies to enhance mobility of people and goods, see DVRPC’s [Congestion Management Process](https://www.dvrpc.org/CongestionManagement/). Additionally, DVRPC [Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSM&O)](https://www.dvrpc.org/Transportation/TSMO/) planning programs preserve capacity and improve the security, safety, and reliability of the transportation system.

DVRPC’s [_Municipal Implementation Toolbox_](https://www.dvrpc.org/Plan/MIT/) suggests the following tools for improving congestion:
 - [Mobility as a Service (MaaS)](https://www.dvrpc.org/Plan/MIT/mobilityasaservicemaas)
 - [Multimodal Transportation Hubs and Connections](https://www.dvrpc.org/Plan/MIT/multimodaltransportationhubsandconnections)
 - [Travel Demand Management (TDM)](https://www.dvrpc.org/Plan/MIT/traveldemandmanagementtdm)
 - [Trip Reduction Ordinances](https://www.dvrpc.org/Plan/MIT/tripreductionordinances) 
 - [Truck Route Network Designation](https://www.dvrpc.org/Plan/MIT/truckroutenetworkdesignation)
