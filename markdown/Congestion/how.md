Regional freeways have held fairly consistent reliability scores on weekdays in recent years. There was a minor decline in PTI values in the period spanning 2011 (1.33) and 2018 (1.30), indicating 2.3% greater freeway reliability. The lowest PTI score was 1.28, occurring both in 2012 and 2017. 2015 was the second highest with a score of 1.32. Local facilities had weekday daily values in a similar range but showed a steady decline of 0.01 each year from 2014 (1.31) to 2018 (1.27)â€”a 3.5% increase in reliability.

Among DVRPC counties, Philadelphia consistently ranks highest for both freeway and local PTI scores. Gloucester and Chester counties rank lowest in the index, or nearest to uncongested conditions.

Reliability is highly conditional on time period, however. The second chart shows that a weekday evening peak period of 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM is when reliable travel speeds most suffer, particularly on freeways. Down from its peak in 2011 (1.80), the 2018 evening peak was 1.70. By comparison, weekday morning peak periods average around 1.40 on freeways and drop to around 1.10 for overnight. Local facilities tend to have less variability by time period, with weekday morning, midday, and evening values around 1.40 to 1.50. Nighttime is notably lower (averaging 1.11 from 2014 to 2018).
