Regional freeways have held fairly consistent reliability scores on weekdays in recent years. There was a minor increase in Planning Time Index (PTI) values in the period spanning 2011 (1.36) to 2021 (1.38), indicating 1.5% less freeway reliability. The lowest PTI score was 1.2, occurring in 2020 when travel was greatly reduced due to the shutdowns caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. By 2021 freeway PTI levels were back to normal (1.36). Just before the pandemic, 2018 and 2019 were tied for highest PTI at 1.41. Local facilities are tracked as far back as 2014, which was tied with 2015 for the peak level of unreliable local roadways with PTI values of 1.39. Contrary to freeways, the local roads havenâ€™t stopped their downward PTI trend since dropping in 2020. 2022 was the most reliable year for local roads with a PTI of 1.25.

Philadelphia consistently ranks highest for both freeway and local PTI scores, meaning it has the least reliable roads. Gloucester is most frequently ranked the lowest, or most reliable, in the index.

Reliability is highly conditional on time period. The second chart shows that a weekday evening peak period of 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM is when travel is the least reliable, particularly on freeways. Down from its peak in 2011 (1.68), the 2020 freeway evening peak dropped to 1.36, then rebounded to 1.60 in 2022. By comparison, weekday freeway morning peak periods average around 1.37. Trips have become more spread throughout the day since the pandemic. As a result, Midday reliability has been decreasing and now looks very similar to AM Peak reliability. Midday PTI  exceeded the AM peak period PTI for local roads in 2020 and and for both freeways and local roads in 2021. The local AM peak just barely nudged out midday reliability in 2022. Local facilities tend to have less variability by time period, with weekday morning, midday, and evening values around 1.25 to 1.50. Nighttime is notably lower, averaging 1.12 on Freeways from 2011 to 2021 and 1.17 on local facilities from 2014 to 2021.
