Nonrecurring congestion is measured as an index value. It is the ratio of the 95th percentile travel time relative to the free-flow (uncongested) travel time and known as the _Planning Time Index_ (PTI). PTI helps in understanding the impacts of nonrecurring congestion from crashes, weather, and special events. This approximates the extent to which a traveler should add extra time to their trip to ensure on-time arrival at their destination. A value of 1.0 indicates a person can expect free-flow speeds along their route. A 2.0 index value indicates a traveler should expect that the trip could be twice as long as free-flow conditions. PTI values from 2.0 to 3.0 are considered moderately unreliability and ones greater than 3.0 are highly unreliable.

The data comes from aggregated Global Positioning System probe data—data from mobile apps, connected vehicles, and commercial fleets—provided to the Probe Data Analytics (PDA) Suite by INRIX, a travel data technology company. The PDA Suite was created by a consortium of sponsors, including the Eastern Transportation Coalition and the University of Maryland.

PTI values by region, subregion, and county are grouped either as freeway facilities or local roads in the first chart. _Freeways_ reflects roadway segments classified as interstates, turnpikes, and expressways in the PDA Suite. _Local roads_ are segments classified as U.S. routes, state routes, parkways, frontages, and others. The PDA Suite reports out weekday hourly averages in facility directions (northbound, southbound, eastbound, and westbound) by selected facility types and geographies. The second chart reports an average of these hourly and directional values by facility type, within the following time periods:
* Morning (AM): 6:00 AM–9:59 AM;
* Midday (MD): 10:00 AM–2:59 PM;
* Evening (PM): 3:00 PM–6:59 PM;
* Nighttime (NT): 7:00 PM–5:59 AM; and
* Daily: 12:00 AM–11:59 PM.

All values reflect an average weekday.

Although INRIX data collection precedes years reported in _Tracking Progress_, early years of reporting are highly variable based on a lack of facility coverage. The years from 2011 onward show higher stability for freeway facilities for most counties and for the region. For local facilities, 2014 and beyond is where values seem most stable due to more widespread facility coverage.

It's important to note that congestion is susceptible to external forces like the economy. A downturn can make for seeming improvements in congestion, but it's really reflecting fewer and shorter trips in leaner times for households and businesses, and may not represent an improvement. Therefore, it may be useful to correlate these results with the Miles Driven indicator.
