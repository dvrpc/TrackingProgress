One measure used to analyze roadway reliability is the _Planning Time Index_ (PTI). It is the ratio of the 95th percentile travel time relative to the free-flow (uncongested) travel time. PTI helps in understanding the impacts of nonrecurring congestion from crashes, weather, and special events. It approximates the extent to which a traveler should add extra time to their trip to ensure on-time arrival at their destination. A value of 1.0 indicates a person can expect free-flow speeds along their route. A 2.0 index value indicates a traveler should expect that the trip could be twice as long as free-flow conditions. PTI values from 2.0 to 3.0 indicate moderate unreliability, and ones greater than 3.0 are highly unreliable. 

The data comes from aggregated Global Positioning System probe data—anonymized data from mobile apps, connected vehicles, and commercial fleets—provided to the Probe Data Analytics (PDA) Suite by INRIX, a travel data technology company. The PDA Suite was created by a consortium of sponsors, including the Eastern Transportation Coalition and the University of Maryland.

PTI values by region, subregion, and county are grouped either as highway facilities or local roads in the first chart. _Highways_ are roadway segments classified as interstates, turnpikes, and expressways in the PDA Suite. _Local roads_ are segments classified as U.S. routes, state routes, parkways, frontages, and others. The PDA Suite reports weekday hourly averages by facility type and direction. The second chart reports average weekday values by facility type and direction, within the following time periods:

* Morning (AM): 6:00 AM–9:59 AM;
* Midday (MD): 10:00 AM–2:59 PM;
* Evening (PM): 3:00 PM–6:59 PM;
* Nighttime (NT): 7:00 PM–5:59 AM; and
* Daily: 12:00 AM–11:59 PM.

Although INRIX data collection precedes years reported in _Tracking Progress_, early years of reporting are highly variable based on a lack of facility coverage. The years from 2011 onward show higher stability for highway facilities for most counties and for the region. For local facilities, 2014 and beyond is where values seem most stable due to more widespread facility coverage.

Charts 2 through 4 show historic data for the federal Transportation Performance Management (TPM) system performance reporting requirements. These are Level of Travel Time Reliability (LOTTR), Level of Truck Travel Time Reliability (TTTR), and Annual Hours of Peak-Hour Excessive Delay (AHPHED). The entire states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey are included in Charts 2 and 3 so the region’s figures can be compared with statewide data.

LOTTR is used to calculate the percentage of roadway segments that are _considered reliable_. A road segment with an LOTTR of less than 1.5 is considered reliable. Reliable segment lengths in miles are multiplied by their Annual average daily traffic (AADT) values times the average number of people in a vehicle. Then, this sum is then divided by the exact same product for all road segments, to get the resulting _percentage_ of roadway that is reliable for the geography. 

TTTR measures how consistent travel times are for trucks on interstates. This can be helpful with analyzing goods movement along the region’s interstates. TTTR is calculated by dividing the 95th percentile of travel times by the 50th percentile of travel times, using the highest value over the Morning (AM), Midday (MD), Evening (PM), Nighttime (NT), and weekend. Each interstate segment multiplies its length by the travel time ratio, the results are summed and then divided by total Interstate length in the geography to determine the area’s TTTR value. 

AHPHED is the average number of hours per year spent by motorists driving in congestion during peak periods. This can be useful for analyzing the impact of congestion from an individual’s perspective, since it analyzes how many hours the average person spends stuck in congestion. The figures used are based on the 2010 urbanized area boundaries in the Census. In 2020, they were renamed to urban areas. There are only Mercer County PHED values from 2021 onward, because they only apply to the second four-year TPM performance period, when the Trenton, NJ Urban Area was required to track metrics and set performance targets. AHPHED per capita is that figure divided by the urban area’s population during that year.

Congestion is susceptible to external forces like the economy. A downturn can reduce congestion, but this reflects fewer and shorter trips for households and businesses during lean times and may not represent an improvement. Therefore, it may be useful to correlate these results with the Miles Driven indicator.
