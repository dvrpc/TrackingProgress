Residential construction activity data is derived from current reports and publications compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau's Residential Construction Statistics Division. Municipalities provide the U.S. Census Bureau with tabulations of the number of housing units authorized, according to types of structures. In the few cases where municipalities reported building permit activity for some months but not for all 12 months, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates the total yearly number of building permits based on past building permit activity.

The first chart looks at where residential development activity is occurring. The Connections 2050 Plan defines four planning areas: Core Cities, Developed Communities, Growing Suburbs, and Rural Areas. Development activity in Core Cities and Developed Communities utilizes existing infrastructure and helps preserve undeveloped land. The chart shows the trendline for percentage of building permits approved in Core Cities and Developed Communities since 1980.

The second chart shows the count of all permits approved by all four Planning Areas.

The third chart presents units authorized by structure type. Note that mobile homes are not included in residential building permits data. The following are definitions of structure types used:

- _Single-family_ are single-unit structures, including attached, detached and semi-detached, and row houses, provided the units are separated by a ground-to-roof party wall.
- _Small multifamily_ structures are those containing two to four units, including duplexes and triplexes.
- _Large multifamily_ structures are those with five or more units. Garden apartments and high-rise buildings are included in this category, as well as condominiums and cooperatively owned apartment buildings.

All three charts allow you to view trends both annually and cumulatively since the base year of 1980.
