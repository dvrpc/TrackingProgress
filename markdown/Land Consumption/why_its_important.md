Greater Philadelphia must balance a variety of land uses to maintain a high quality of life for its residents and visitors with the finite amount of land available. One of the most important land use decisions that our region's decision-makers face is choosing to develop open space for housing, business, or industry; or to protect it for recreation, water quality, habitat, natural beauty, or farmland. Over the past 75 years, land consumption has increased at a rate nearly five times the region's population growth, resulting in sprawling development patterns. There are many negative effects of this inefficient use of the region's land, including:

- increased reliance on motorized transportation, which in turn results in the congestion of our roadways and an increased need for new infrastructure to reduce this congestion;
- increased need for redundant amenities and services as communities become more spread out;
- more time each day spent traveling between destinations, which affects mental and physical health;
- challenges to, if not loss of, local agricultural economies;
- a weakening of the ability of other species to thrive as their habitats are lost or movement between habitats is prevented; and
- detrimental impacts to air and water quality.
