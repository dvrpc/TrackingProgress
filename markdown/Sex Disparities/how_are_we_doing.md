The gap in median income between male and female persons in the region declined from $17,581 in 2000 to $12,403 in 2017—a 29.5% drop. Looking at the male and female medians themselves, the drop in the income gap is attributable to declining incomes of male persons combined with more stagnant income for female persons in that period—meaning that income for the entire working population has declined since 2000. Male income declined or stayed stagnant for six consecutive years due to the recession. It went from $49,308 in 2008 to $43,9001 in 2014 and only climbed halfway back to pre-recession levels by 2017 ($46,400). Some of this may be attributable to an older, more male-dominated generation of workers dropping out of the workforce or having to settle with compensation below what they received prior to the recession. Female median income dropped by about $1,700 due to the recession. The median was $33,712 in 2008 and dipped to its lowest point in 2013 ($32,004). It fully recovered to 2008 levels in 2017 ($33,997). Although clearly better than 2000, female percentage of male median income has vacillated between 72 and 74% from 2011 to 2017. With slightly higher post-recession income gains for males, it remains to be seen whether the improvements since the turn of the millennium will reverse into a widening gap again, stay at recent levels, or drop again soon.

The gap between male and female labor force participation rates has dropped overall but has shown some minor increases in disparities in recent years. The year 2005 had a gap of 11.8%. This dropped to 7.0% in 2011 but climbed slightly to 8.3% in 2017. Male participation held in a slightly tighter range in these years: 84.8% for a high in 2005 and 81.6 in 2011 for a low. Female participation had a low of 72.9% in 2005 and a high of 75.5 in 2009. In 2017, male participation was at 82.5% and female was at 74.2.
