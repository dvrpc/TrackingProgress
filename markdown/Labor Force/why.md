A strong labor force is essential for the region’s economic vitality. Businesses stick around, expand, or locate in regions with a diverse labor force. Employment opportunities are a key ingredient for individuals, families, and communities to generate wealth and spend it on local businesses, in a reciprocal cycle that grows businesses and job opportunities. Labor force is a measure of who is employed or actively engaged in seeking employment. If individuals feel shut out from opportunities, underskilled, or that circumstances don’t allow them to work, opportunities to strengthen households, communities, and local businesses may be lost.
