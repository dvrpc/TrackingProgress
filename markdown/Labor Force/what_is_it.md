Labor force participation rate is a measure of the active workforce. It is the total number of those employed or actively seeking employment, divided by the total working age population. 

Labor Force Participation Gap between Sexes (Ages 20 to 64) shows the gap in participation rate between male and female persons. Labor Force Participation by Sex (Ages 20 to 64) shows the percentage of participation for male and female persons in that age range. Note: the U.S Census Bureau’s ACS asks "What is Person[x]'s sex?" and offers two check boxes: male or female. Since the survey refers to sex, we use the same term, recognizing it has limits. The term sex is also in line with the protections against discrimination based on sex found in the [Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/23/324)—a law DVRPC must comply with as a public agency receiving federal funds.

Labor Force Participation Gap Relative to white Participation Rate (Ages 16 and Older) examines labor force participation rates by racial and ethnic groups. Labor Force Participation by Race (Ages 16 and Older) shows participation rate by five ACS race categories. The _People of Color (POC)_ trendline comprises any racial or ethnic group that is Latinx _and_ not white alone. _Latinx_ represents those who list themselves as having a Hispanic or Latino origin in the ACS. In the Greater Philadelphia region, only 1.7% of the Latinx population identified as white in the 2020 Census. POC groups that aren’t large enough in most counties to show a consistent trend, such as Native Americans or those with two or more races, are not shown.

To create estimates of participation rates for groups and geographies not reported by the Census Bureau, weighted averages were employed. For aggregate geographies, such as the nine-county region, county participation rates were weighted by each county’s population 20 to 64 years old by sex, and by population 16 and older by race or ethnicity. People of Color participation estimates were weighted by each component group’s population 16 and over in each county. One-year ACS labor participation rate data is presented from 2005 to 2009. Five-year ACS data is used from 2010 on.

When the sample of any racial or ethnic is too low, the Census Bureau suppresses the data. Consequently, some years don’t have estimates, and they won’t appear on the trendlines. Estimates that aren’t suppressed for groups with a small population share are likely to be more variable from year-to-year, as data quality suffers from the lack of a representative sample. Users should use caution when interpreting results.

_Note: The Census Bureau issued [a statement acknowledging errors in 2017 ACS data for Philadelphia County](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/errata/121.html). Philadelphia estimates for geography of residence are omitted as a result, but the error may impact the regional aggregations.  Also note, the 2020 one-year ACS was not released due to disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic._
