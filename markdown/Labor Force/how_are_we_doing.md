Greater Philadelphia’s gap between male and female labor force participation rates has closed by 5.3% since 2005. As seen in _Labor Force Participation by Sex (Ages 20 to 64)_, the regional male participation rate was 84.5% and the female participation rate was 78.0% in 2022. The counties closing the gap the most were Mercer, Philadelphia, and Burlington—down 8.1%, 6.6%, and 6.5%, respectively. Closing the least in the period were Gloucester (0.3% drop), Delaware (3.4% drop), and Montgomery (4.4% drop). In 2022, two counties had male to female participation gaps that were still greater than 10%: Gloucester (10.5%) and Chester (10.4%). The counties with the smallest gaps by sex were Philadelphia (2.2%), Mercer (5.1%), and Burlington (6.3%).

Regionally, between 2019 and 2022, the male and female labor force participation rate gap was steady. There’s a different story to be told on either side of the Delaware River. Pennsylvania counties’ gaps closed. New Jersey counties’ gaps widened, particularly in Gloucester County, where the gap went from 6.5% to 10.5%. Due to Gloucester County’s smaller population to sample, ACS data quality can suffer and trendlines can be more volatile as a result. The next data release will lend a better understanding of longer term trends.

As seen in _Labor Force Participation by Race (Ages 16 and Older)_, by 2022, white labor force participation rates were lower than the other racial and ethnic groups or second lowest in most counties. An exception was Philadelphia, where the white participation rate was 2nd highest. 

The labor force participation rate gap between the region’s white, non-Latinx population, and People of Color (POC) and Latinx has notably decreased in recent years. The former dropped from 66.0 to 65.7% participation, while the latter increased from 64.2 to 66.1% participation.  Regionally, gaps among all racial and ethnic groupings closed, except for Latinx. Latinx to white labor force participation gaps show more volatile trends due to their smaller portion of the regional population and sampling challenges. In Philadelphia,  the participation gap decreased among race groups in 2022 after having widened for several years beforehand. The POC & Latinx gap from white, non-Latinx widened from 2% in 2006 to 6.8% in 2021, but then closed again to 3.8% in 2022. This same trend occurs in the individual racial and ethnic groupings, where the Black, non-Latinx to white, non-Latinx gap closed 2.7%, and the Asian, non-Latinx to white, non-Latinx gap closed 2.6%. All of this lends to a general trend of POC  participating in the labor force at more similar rates to whites within the last year.
