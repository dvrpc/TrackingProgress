From 2006 to 2014, the percentage of waterbodies attaining water quality standards declined 8.7%. This figure held relatively steady (between 35% and 39% in attainment) between 2006 and 2012 before declining more dramatically to only 26% of waterbodies in attainment in 2014 (the last year data is available for both states). Pennsylvania saw a more dramatic decrease in waterbodies in attainmentâ€”57% in 2012 to 39% in 2014. From 2002 to 2014, the percentage of attaining subwatersheds in New Jersey has held relatively steady between 13% and 18%.

However, this decline does not necessarily reflect an actual reduction in the quality of surface water. Prior to releasing the 2014 report, PADEP adopted more stringent biological assessment protocols. As a result, a number of previously attaining streams were downgraded, and this is reflected in the significant drop between the 2012 and 2014 reports. As of 2016, almost all streams have been reassessed with the new protocol, and the overall number of attaining stream miles declined only slightly since 2014 (from 1,507.2 miles to 1,440.5 miles).
