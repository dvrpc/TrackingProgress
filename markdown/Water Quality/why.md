Clean water is a fundamental need for people in our region. It is vital for agriculture, manufacturing, and the region's drinking water supply.  Clean water also serves as the foundation for many of our recreational offerings, notably swimming, boating, and fishing.  And for many other species in our region, water is home, and clean water means healthy ponds, lakes, streams, and wetlands.
