Four different agencies provide transit service to the region. SEPTA provides bus and rail service to all five southeastern Pennsylvania counties and has two commuter rail lines that terminate outside this service area, in New Castle County, Delaware; and Mercer County, New Jersey. The Port Authority Transit Corporation (PATCO) operates a passenger rail line connecting Philadelphia with Camden County. New Jersey Transit (NJ Transit) runs buses throughout the four southern New Jersey counties and into Philadelphia and has three rail lines in the region: the RiverLine connecting Camden and Mercer counties, and two commuter rail lines connecting Philadelphia and Atlantic City and Mercer County to New York City. Finally, Pottstown Area Rapid Transit (PART) provides bus service throughout the Borough of Pottstown and into several neighboring municipalities.

The Federal Transit Administration's (FTA's) Transportation Performance Management (TPM) measures gauge transit system conditions with four indicators: (1) the percentage of _revenue_ service vehicles that have either met or exceeded their useful life benchmark (ULB) as identified by the transit agency; (2) the percentage of _support_ vehicles in each asset class that have either met or exceeded their ULB; (3) the percentage of facilities in deficient condition; and (4) the percentage of rail track mileage with performance restrictions. The year 2019 was the first year for the initial four-year targets for federally-required Transportation Performance Management (TPM) goals, and is used as the base year for this indicator.

The graphs here present the number and percentage of revenue and support vehicles past their Useful Life Benchmark (ULB) broken down by vehicle type, percentage of transit facilities in deficient condition broken down by facility type, and percentage of rail track mileage with performance restrictions, as reported by each of the region's transit agencies to the FTA's National Transit Database (NTD).

The first and second charts depict the number and percentage of revenue and support vehicles past their Useful Life Benchmark (ULB), broken down by agency and vehicle type. The NTD includes data for all vehicle types, but only the vehicle types the region’s transit agencies own have been graphed. The NTD does not break down these figures by counties in which the vehicles operate. As a result, New Jersey Transit’s figures are statewide for any vehicle fleet known to operate in the region. Use the dropdown menus to select individual or all transit agencies, and total or percent of vehicles past their ULB. Use the radio buttons to select individual vehicle fleets or the sum of all vehicle types. 

The third chart depicts the percentage of transit facilities which are in deficient condition, broken down by passenger and administrative facilities. Facilities of each type rated below condition 3 on the Transit Economic Requirements Model (TERM) scale (which ranges from 1 = _poor_ condition to 5 = _excellent_ condition) are considered to be in deficient condition. Since the NTD breaks down facilities by location, only New Jersey Transit facilities in the region are included in this chart. Use the dropdown menu to select individual or all transit agencies.

The fourth chart shows the percentage of rail track mileage with performance restrictions, broken down by agency. New Jersey Transit’s RiverLine is the only hybrid rail system in the state and is included in this chart. Only about 6% of New Jersey Transit commuter rail track is located in the DVRPC region. As a result, it is not included in this chart. Use the radio buttons to select individual or all transit agencies’ types of rail vehicles which they operate in the region.
