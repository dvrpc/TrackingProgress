A well-maintained transit system is vital to moving people around the region. When transit is not maintained, the risk of delayed or canceled rides increases and reliability decreases. As a result, passengers can be discouraged from using transit, and users are more likely to choose to drive, causing more congestion, crashes, and air pollution throughout the region. Those who do not have another option, or cannot afford one, may not be able to reach jobs, medical appointments, education programs, or other important activities. A poorly maintained transit system is also less energy efficient, and requires more regular, costly repairs to stay operational. Keeping all this infrastructure in good condition, while incorporating new technologies and infrastructure, is essential to the region.
