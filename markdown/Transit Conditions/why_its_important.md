A well-maintained transit system is vital to moving people around the region. When transit is not maintained, the risk of delayed or cancelled rides increases and reliability decreases. As a result, passengers can be discouraged from using transit and users are more likely to choose to drive, causing more congestion, crashes, and air pollution throughout the region. Those who don't have another option, or can't afford one, may not be able to reach jobs, medical appointments, education programs, or other important activities. A poorly maintained transit system is also less energy efficient and requires more regular, costly repairs to stay operational. Much of the region's transit infrastructure spans the 20th century. The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) alone has rail bridges that are a century old, power substations and catenary from the 1930s, commuter train cars from the 1970s, and trolleys from the 1980s. Keeping all this historic infrastructure in functional repair while incorporating new technologies and infrastructure is essential to the region.
