Since 2000, the percentage of the region's residents (25 or more years old) that have completed high school has risen from 82.2% to 91.9% in 2021, or nearly 10%. When considering educational attainment by planning area, however, it is clear that the region's greatest challenge lies in resolving the disparity between educational levels attained in the region's urban core versus suburban areas. Although the high school completion rate has risen to 85.3% in Core Cities based on 2017â€“2021 five-year estimates, this still significantly lags behind the 93.6% and 95.2% rates in Developed Communities and Growing Suburbs, respectively.

The number of residents in the region with a bachelor's degree or higher has also continued to grow. In 2000, 1,004,492 residents had at least a bachelor's degree. In 2021, that number rose to 1,756,795, an increase of 75%.
