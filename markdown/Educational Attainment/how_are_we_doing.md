The percentage of the region's residents (25 years or older) that have completed high school has risen nearly 10%, from 82.2% in 2000 to 92.1% in 2022. When considering educational attainment by regional Planning Area, however, it is clear that the region's greatest challenge lies in resolving the disparity between educational levels attained in the region's Core Cities versus the other three Planning Area types: Developed Communities, Growing Suburbs, and Rural Areas. Although the high school completion rate has risen to 85.8% in Core Cities based on 2018â€“2022 five-year estimates, this still significantly lags behind the 93.6% and 95.4% rates in Developed Communities and Growing Suburbs, respectively.

The number of residents in the region with a bachelor's degree or higher has also continued to grow. In 2000, 1,004,492 residents had at least a bachelor's degree. In 2022, that number rose to 1,770,545, a 76% increase.
