The latest air quality data from the US EPA shows the region is continuing to reduce ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollutants. Although air quality is greatly influenced by weather conditions, days violating National Ambient Air Quality Standards and the severity of those days have declined steadily over the past two decades. The 2021 five-year average (2017–2021) had 58 fewer days per year that violated standards than did the 2002 five-year average (1998–2002)—the peak of the period shown.

The first chart shows that from 2017 to 2021 the region has averaged just 16 days per year that violate current air quality standards. Notably, the Covid-19 Pandemic reduced 2020 air quality violation days to the lowest levels seen since monitoring began, with only 8 violating days, due to an extreme drop in travel. 

The second chart shows that concentrations of both pollutants are decreasing in severity. The last Very Unhealthy day for both ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub> occurred in 2008. Ozone violations are more common than PM<sub>2.5</sub>, thanks to advances made to reduce PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels through power plant and diesel-powered engine regulations. Ozone is particularly seasonal—with violations occurring primarily in the second and third quarters of the year, due to higher levels of heat and sunlight in those periods.

Federal standards have had a dramatic effect in reducing emissions and unhealthy air quality days over the past few decades. Public health has benefitted from greater awareness of pollutants and ways to lessen their impact. However, climate change may counter the progress the nation has made in improving air quality, as higher temperatures increase the potential for forming ground-level ozone, which is likely to result in more days that violate national standards.
