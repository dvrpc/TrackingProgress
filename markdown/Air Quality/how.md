The latest air quality data from the US EPA shows the region is continuing to reduce ozone and PM2.5 pollutants. Days violating National Ambient Air Quality Standards and the severity of those days have declined steadily over the past two decades. The 2018 five-year average (2014–2018) saw 109 fewer days per year violating standards than did the 2000 five-year average (1996–2000).

As seen in the first chart, from 2014 to 2018, the region has averaged just 22 days per year that would violate the current air quality standards. Although air quality is greatly influenced by weather conditions, long-term trends over the last 20 years, show a dramatic decrease in days that violate national standards. The second chart shows that concentrations of both pollutants are decreasing in severity. The last Very Unhealthy day for ozone occurred in 2007; and for PM2.5, it was 2008. Ozone violations are more common than PM2.5, thanks to great strides made to reduce PM2.5 levels through power plant and diesel-powered engine regulations.

The dramatic declines in unhealthy air quality days over the past few decades show the impact federal standards have had in reducing emissions, along with greater public awareness of pollutants and ways to lessen their impact. However, climate change may counter the progress the nation has made in improving air quality, as higher temperatures increase the potential for forming ground-level ozone, resulting in more days that violate national standards.
