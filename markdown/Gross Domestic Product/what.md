GDP is an economy’s value of the goods and services minus the value of goods and services used to produce them. GDP is also known as “value added.” The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) made county-level GDP estimates available in recent years, from which we can calculate the region’s GDP. More information on their methods can be found [here](https://apps.bea.gov/scb/issues/2020/03-march/0320-county-level-gdp.htm).

The first chart displays the trend of total GDP, as well as annual and cumulative change rates since 2001. Industry is divided into three main categories of Goods, Services, and Government and government enterprises. Goods and Services are each subdivided into their respective sectors. Manufactured goods are further divided into durable and non-durable goods.

The second chart shows the share of each industry within the region’s and each sub-geography’s total GDP. The third chart shows the share of the regional GDP produced by each county.
