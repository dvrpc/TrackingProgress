GDP is an economy’s value of the goods and services minus the value of goods and services used to produce them. GDP is also known as “value added.” The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) made county-level GDP estimates available in recent years, which can be used to calculate the region’s GDP. More information on their methods can be found [here](https://apps.bea.gov/scb/issues/2020/03-march/0320-county-level-gdp.htm).

The first chart displays the trend of total GDP by geography, as well as annual and cumulative change rates since 2001.  \
The industry drop-down is divided into three main categories: Goods, Services, and Government and government enterprises.  Under Goods, Manufacturing is further divided into Durable and Nondurable Goods.

The second chart shows the share of the regional GDP produced by each county.

The third chart shows the share of each industry within the region and each sub-geography’s total GDP.
