Although not a full picture of societal well-being, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a valuable measure of economic activity. GDP growth can spur opportunity for the region's residents in the form of job and income growth, which can reduce poverty.  It is also a good indicator of how well our region is moving toward the _Connections 2050_ Plan goals to improve global connections through facilitated goods movement, aviation, and multimodal intercity connections; and expanded internet access and small business growth.
