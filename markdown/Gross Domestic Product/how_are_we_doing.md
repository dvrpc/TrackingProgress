The Greater Philadelphia economy more than doubled in size over two decades, with GDP rising from $261 million in 2001 to $536 million in 2021—a 105% increase. This falls between the growth rates of the region’s two states—New Jersey’s economy increased by 99% and Pennsylvania by 116% in the same period. In comparison, the U.S. economy grew by 141% in that time. In those 20 years, four counties exceeded the regional growth rate: Chester County (130%), Mercer County (128%), Philadelphia (114%), and Gloucester County (106%). All four saw growth in Services and Government and government enterprises. Mercer was the only one with significant Goods growth, stemming from a large boost to Nondurable Goods Manufacturing in 2019, 2020 and 2021. This is potentially due to New Jersey’s legalization and Mercer’s subsequent production of legal marijuana.

The top three counties for regional GDP—Philadelphia with 25-28% share, Montgomery with 19-21% share, and Chester with 10-11% share—accounted for at least 55% of GDP for all 20 years from 2001 to 2021. The region’s Pennsylvania counties overall have an outsized influence on the economy, contributing nearly 75% of GDP for 20 years straight.

The largest industry contributing to Greater Philadelphia’s overall GDP is Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate, staying consistently around 20-22% of GDP. Professional Services has grown from 13.3% share of the region’s GDP in 2001, to a 17.2% share in 2021. While Manufacturing declined from 2001 to 2012 (12.5% to 7.5% share), it rebounded back to a 10.6% share in 2021. The Arts, Entertainment, Recreation, Food, and Accommodations sector was, unsurprisingly, the most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, but largely recovered by 2021.
