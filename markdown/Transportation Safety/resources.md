DVRPC does extensive work analyzing and promoting the safety of the region’s transportation system. Find publications, programs, and tools from our [Office of Safe Streets](https://www.dvrpc.org/Transportation/Safety/). Recent highlights include the [Transportation Safety Analysis and Plan](https://www.dvrpc.org/Products/18021/) and a report on [Crashes and Communities of Concern in the Greater Philadelphia Region](https://www.dvrpc.org/Products/18022/). In 2022 DVRPC was awarded a Safe Streets and Roads For All (SS4A) grant to develop a [Regional Vision Zero](https://www.dvrpc.org/transportation/safety/visionzero/) (RVZ) plan which is being created in collaboration with county partners. In 2024 DVRPC received a second SS4A grant to conduct RVZ plan next step activities including Regional High Injury Network corridor studies.

Improving safety outcomes one the National Goals set by the Federal Highway Administration and Federal Transit Administration’s Transportation Performance Management (TPM). DVRPC is required to either set regional targets or match state department of transportation targets for the number and rate of fatalities, the number and rate of serious injuries, and the number of non-motorized fatalities. DVRPC is required to either set regional targets or match transit agency targets for fatalities, injuries, safety events, and system reliability.
