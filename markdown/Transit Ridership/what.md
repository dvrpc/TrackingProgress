DVRPC tracks transit ridership in the region through unlinked passenger trips, with data provided by each of the region's four transit operators—Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), New Jersey Transit (NJ Transit), Port Authority Transit Corporation (PATCO), and Pottstown Area Rapid Transit (PART)—to the National Transit Database (NTD). Unlinked passenger trips count each passenger boarding, regardless of fare paid. Thus, a trip with a transfer would count as two boardings. Transit ridership does not include Amtrak, shuttles, or private bus passengers. It also does not include services that receive partial funding from SEPTA like SCCOOT and Krapf's "A" Bus.

The first chart shows the overall number of unlinked trips that occurred in the region each year. The second shows the number of unlinked trips by mode (i.e., bus, rail, etc.). Non-scheduled services refers to modes provided on demand like paratransit. The third chart shows the number of unlinked trips by transit operator. All three graphs can be toggled between total unlinked trips and unlinked trips per capita.

NJ Transit's ridership figures are for the DVRPC region only. These figures are based on service in the Trenton and Philadelphia Urbanized Area collected by the NTD. PART data is only available from 2008 onward.
