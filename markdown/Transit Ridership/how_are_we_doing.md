The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated declines in transit ridership that dated back to 2012. After peaking that year at 406 million unlinked trips, ridership declined by 13 percent by 2019. Buses, trolley buses, and light rail had the greatest declines during this period. From 2019 to 2021, ridership decreased by another 65 percent, predominantly in response to the impacts of theCOVID pandemic. Commuter rail, subways, and light rail had even higher drops in ridership. In 2022, ridership was 202 million unlinked trips, a 62 percent increase relative to 2021—but less than half of what it was in 2012. Transit agencies around the country have been experiencing similar ridership losses. Fares paid by riders go toward funding operating costs. The 2020 _Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security_ (CARES) Act provided $25 billion to transit agencies around the nation to make up for lost revenue. As this source dwindles, transit agencies are facing a fiscal cliff that could require service cuts, which would make it harder to return to pre-pandemic ridership levels.  

Buses were by far the most commonly used transit mode in the region from 2000 to 2022, serving 53 percent of riders during that period. Subways are the second highest, carrying 27 percent of all unlinked trips over this period, while commuter rail is third at 10 percent. 

SEPTA is responsible for carrying the majority of the region's transit passengers, accounting for 174.2 million unlinked trips in 2022, though this represents a decline of 43 percent since 2019. Second was NJ Transit, with 22.4 million unlinked trips, down by 30 percent since 2019. Riders took 4.9 million unlinked trips on PATCO in 2022—a 56 percent drop since 2019—and 136,000 on PART—which is a decrease of 41 percent since 2019.
