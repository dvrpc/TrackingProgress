After more than a decade of steady growth between 2000 and 2013, transit ridership began to decrease. It suffered an especially sharp decrease between 2016 and 2017 due largely to a significant decline in bus trips. Between 2000 and 2017, unlinked transit trips per capita have declined by 1.1% (65.05 unlinked trips per capita in 2000 versus 64.34 unlinked trips per capita in 2017). Whether this trend reverses and restarts the growth from earlier in the decade or continues to decline will have significant ramifications for the sustainability of the transit system and the overall transportation network.

Buses are by far the most commonly used transit mode in the region, at 33.07 unlinked trips per capita in 2017, followed by subways at 18.23 unlinked trips. Commuter and light rail are third and fourth at 6.48 and 5.09 unlinked trips per capita, respectively. All modes except for light rail saw at least a small decline between 2016 and 2017.

SEPTA is responsible for carrying the majority of the region's transit passengers, accounting for 324.8 million unlinked trips in 2017. Second was NJ Transit with 33.8 million unlinked trips, or about 10.4% of SEPTA's total. Riders took 10.8 million unlinked trips on PATCO and 244,000 on PART.
