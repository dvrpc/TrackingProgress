Increasing transit ridership is critical to an integrated multimodal transportation network that provides accessibility and equity for all citizens and visitors throughout the region. Growing transit ridership is related to other key goals set in the _Connections 2050_ Plan. For instance, transit service generally uses less energy and therefore reduces greenhouse gas emissions, relative to driving. Transit can reduce the need to widen or build new roads, helping to create denser, more vibrant, and multimodal communities.
