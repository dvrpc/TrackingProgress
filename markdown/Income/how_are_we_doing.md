In just 15 years, the growth rate between the region’s lowest and highest quintile income households has diverged by 21.4%. First-quintile households' income averaged $18,196 a year in 2006 and dropped by $732 a year, or 6.1%, to $17,078 by 2021. Meanwhile, the fifth-quintile average income went from $244,217 a year to $281,644 a year, a gain of over $37,000—more than twice as much as the average first-quintile household made in 2006 or 2021—or 15.3% of what they yielded in 2006. In this same period, the average second-quintile household had a small increase in average income, from $47,326 in 2006 to $48,839 in 2021, or 3.1%, while the third and fourth quintiles gained 6.5% and 9.1%, respectively.

All groups were impacted by the Great Recession, but the highest income groups had a shorter period of losses and quicker recovery. In 2011 the top quintile and top 5% of income households saw their lowest average income. It would take until 2014 for the lower four quintiles of households to see a clear rise from 2011 levels. The lowest quintile stayed well below 2011 levels until 2015, then lost and gained for a few more years, and by 2021, with an average of $17,078 a year, were barely above 2011 ($17,029) and still below 2006 ($18,196) income. The households comprising each quintile are not static and may move up or down within these different income quintiles over time.  

The gap in median income between the region's households with a householder of color and white, non-Latinx householders is wide. It grew, marginally, from $36,497 in 2000 to $38,551 in 2021. POC householders’ median household income is about 40% of white householder’s. Among POC householders, the gap from white householder’s household income varies quite a lot. Asian householders’ median household income ranged from $8,300 under to $10,400 over white householders’ during the 21 year period, while Black householders’ median income gap grew from $39,300 under white householders’ to $50,500. Since Black householders’ income was down from $51,328 in 2000 to $47,530 in 2021, the gap between Black householders’ and white householders’ median income was greater than Black householders’ median income itself. Like all other householder race or ethnic groups, except Black householders, Latinx householders’ median income grew from 2000 ($50,307) to 2021 ($57,257). Their percentage gap decreased from 44.5% of white householders’ income in 2000 to 41.6% in 2021.

The gap in median earnings between male and female persons in the region declined from $21,579 in 2000 to $14,387 in 2021—a 33% drop. Still, female median earnings were 26.1% less than males in 2021. The decrease in this gap is attributable to declining earnings of males combined with slowly increasing earnings for females over that period. Male earnings decreased almost $3,000 from 2000 ($58,993) to 2021 ($55,122)—a 6.6% drop. Female earnings went from $37,414 in 2000 to $40,735 in 2021—a 8.9% gain. Male earnings were on a downward trend until a low of $49,554 in 2014, and have since seen earnings increase close to 2008 levels in 2021. Some of this may be attributable to an older, more male-dominated generation of workers dropping out of the workforce or having to settle with compensation below what they received prior to the Great Recession, followed by some rebounding earnings. Female earnings similarly saw a similar decline until a low of $35,572 in 2013. By 2017, female median earnings surpassed the prior 2006 high and continued to rise from there.
