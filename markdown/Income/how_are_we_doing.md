In just 16 years, the growth rate between the region’s lowest and highest quintile income households has diverged by 20.0%. First-quintile households' income averaged $19,668 a year in 2006, and dropped by $1,206, or 6.1%, to $18,462 by 2022. Meanwhile, the fifth-quintile average income went from $263,977 a year to $300,760 a year, a gain of almost $37,000—about twice as much as the average first-quintile household made in 2006 or 2022—or 14.0% of what they yielded in 2006. In this same period, the average second-quintile household had a very small increase in average income, from $51,155 in 2006 to $51,610 in 2022, or 0.9%, while the third and fourth quintiles gained 3.7% and 6.4%, respectively.

All groups were impacted by the Great Recession, but the highest income groups had a shorter period of losses and a quicker recovery. In 2011 the top quintile and top 5% of income households saw their lowest average income. It would take until 2014 for the lower four quintiles of households to see a clear rise from 2011 levels. The lowest quintile stayed well below 2011 levels until 2015, then lost and gained for a few more years, and by 2022, with an average of $18,462 a year, had just topped 2006 ($18,196) income. The households comprising each quintile are not static, and may move up or down within these different income quintiles over time.  

The gap in median income between the region's households with a householder of color and white, non-Latinx householders is wide. It declined from $39,450 in 2000 to $37,037 in 2022, a 6.1% decrease. POC householders’ median household income is about 64% of white householders’. Among POC householders, the gap from white householder’s household income varies quite a lot. Asian householders’ median household income ranged from almost $12,000 under to about $9,000 over white householders’ during the 22-year period, while Black householders’ median income gap grew from about $42,500 under white householders’ to about $50,500. Since Black householders’ income was down from $55,482 in 2000 to $51,600 in 2022, the gap between Black householders’ and white householders’ median income was only a little less than Black householders’ median income itself. Like all other householder racial or ethnic groups, except Black householders, Latinx householders’ median income grew from 2000 ($54,378) to 2022 ($61,689). Their percentage gap increased from 55.5% of white householders’ income in 2000 to 60.5% in 2022.

The gap in median earnings between male and female persons in the region declined from $23,325 in 2000 to $15,303 in 2022—a 34% drop. Still, female median earnings were 30.4% less than males in 2022. The decrease in this gap is attributable to declining earnings of males combined with slowly increasing earnings for females over that period. Male earnings decreased almost $6,000 from 2000 ($63,766) to 2022 ($58,009)—a 9.0% drop. Female earnings went from $40,441 in 2000 to $42,706 in 2022—a 5.6% gain. Male earnings were on a downward trend until a low of $53,563 in 2014, and have since seen earnings increase close to 2009 levels in 2022. Some of this may be attributable to an older, more male-dominated generation of workers dropping out of the workforce, or having to settle with compensation below what they received prior to the Great Recession, followed by some rebounding earnings. Female earnings similarly saw a similar decline until a low of $38,450 in 2013. By 2017, female median earnings surpassed the prior 2006 high and continued to rise from there.
