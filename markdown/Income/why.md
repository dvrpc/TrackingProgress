All residents deserve the opportunity to participate and thrive in our economy and communities, but too often the opportunities available fall short of supporting all individuals and families. Without an inclusive economy, economic growth remains out of reach. [Studies](https://gsdrc.org/document-library/causes-and-consequences-of-income-inequality-a-global-perspective/) show that when the top 20% of earners increase incomes by 1%, gross domestic product (GDP) falls, but if the bottom 20% receives a 1% gain in income, GDP increases. The history of racial and ethnic discrimination in both the country and the region has held generations of residents back from accessing the same opportunitiesâ€”particularly in the area of income and wealth building. Also key to an inclusive economy is income equality for women. The financial health of women is critical to the economic health of households, communities, and the region.
