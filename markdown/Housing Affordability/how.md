The percentage of households in the region with a high housing cost burden (those paying over 30% of income on housing) has dropped by 9% since its peak of 41% of households in 2011 to levels lower than at any point in the period from 2005 to 2021. 

The region’s Core Cities’ households had higher percentages of cost-burdened households than the other planning area types. While Core Cities and Developed Communities had higher percentages of cost-burdened households than Growing Suburbs or Rural Areas, those outlying areas may tend toward higher transportation costs.

Cost burden of renters has increased in recent years, with an all-time high of 367,000 households in 2021. Cost-burdened owners have decreased nearly every year from 2011 to 2019, but were up slightly in 2021. 
Those with a severe cost burden—greater than 50% of household income—were seeing a modest decline from 2011 to 2019, but 2021 saw a rise to levels not seen since 2013.
