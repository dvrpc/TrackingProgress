Maintaining a diverse supply of housing at all price points helps ensure that everyone can find a place to live. It is critical to attracting a sufficient labor force, increasing economic prosperity, promoting public health, and providing a high quality of life. Households paying more than 30% of their income on housing may have trouble making other necessary payments and building wealth. Substandard housing conditions, steep home prices, and lower income levels all exacerbate inequities experienced within disadvantaged communities, and can prevent individuals and families from fully accessing the opportunities afforded to others in the region.

This indicator relates to the _Connections 2050_ goals of preserving and building more accessible and affordable housing, and reducing how much of a householdâ€™s income is spent on combined housing and transportation costs.
