DVRPC's Long-Range Plan sets a target of reducing GHG emissions by 80% from 2005 levels by 2050. By 2015, total regional GHG emissions have been reduced by approximately 21% since 2005 (or 19.1% per person).

The largest driver of these reductions was changes in the electricity generation mix, primarily the continued switch from coal to natural gas. Energy generation from coal has dropped from 44.9% in 2004 to just 17.6% in 2016. Because natural gas emits less CO~2~ per kilowatt hour of electricity produced than does coal, the switch has lowered GHG emissions overall. However, because natural gas is still a fossil fuel that produces CO~2~ when combusted, and the switch from coal to natural gas is mostly complete, further GHG reductions from this source are limited.

Despite the region's moderate success in reducing GHG emissions, average annual temperatures and precipitation from severe storms continue to rise, highlighting the effects of climate change on the region. These effects are projected to continue to worsen without continued efforts to reduce GHG emissions on a regional, national, and global scale.
