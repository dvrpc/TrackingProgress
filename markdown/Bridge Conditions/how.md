Over the last two decades the region has made significant progress in improving bridge conditions. Following the lead of federal and each state departments of transportation, DVRPC's "fix-it-first" policy has allocated more funding to preserving and maintaining existing networks, including bridges, in order to achieve and maintain a state of good repair for existing transportation infrastructure. Since peaking at 18% in 2003, deficient deck area has decreased to 8% in 2018—a 54% drop. Total deficient bridges have decreased steadily, both in terms of total number of bridges and deck area (dropping to half of the 2003 tally).

With a mature transportation network, however, asset condition continues to be a significant challenge. Despite dropping deficiency ratings, a large majority of bridges in the region continue to receive a fair rating. The largest single 10-year period for building the region's infrastructure occurred during the 1960s; this means that many of these facilities have reached the end of their useful life and need to be reconstructed soon. This puts the region—especially on the Pennsylvania side with more river and stream crossings—in a precarious position, as just one large bridge dropping to poor condition would erase years of progress with regard to deck area ratings.
