Bridges enable mobility and commerce throughout the region. Bridges with a poor condition rating indicate maintenance needs that do not pose safety issues, as long as they are resolved in a timely manner. A bridge may be repairable depending on factors such as its structural condition and age. Individual components of bridges can be replaced, such as their decks for example. But replacement is generally the more cost-effective option for older bridges with multiple components in poor condition.
