Bridges enable mobility and commerce throughout the region. Bridges with a poor condition rating indicate maintenance needs that do not pose safety issues so long as they are resolved in a timely manner. A bridge may be repairable depending on its structural condition and age. Replacement is generally the more cost-effective option for older bridges with multiple components in poor condition.
