The gap in median income between the region's residents of color and white, non-Latinx residents is wideâ€”it stood at just over $30,000 in 2017. Between 2000 and 2017, the gap has dropped marginally by 6.8% (a little over $2,000). On average, people of color's income was less than two-thirds of white, non-Latinx income in 2017. Regionally, white, non-Latinx workers average $84,352 in yearly income, while people of color average $54,233.

Racial and ethnic segregation among neighborhoods in the region is on the decline. Comparing the concentrations of people of color and Latinx versus white, non-Latinx in each tract relative to the region's overall racial and ethnic makeup, neighborhoods are diversifying. Although theoretical, in 1990, 68.6% of the region's population would have needed to relocate in order to evenly distribute people of color throughout the region. By 2017, the percentage dropped to 54.5. This value still reflects a region where a high percentage of neighborhoods comprise persons of the same race and ethnicity.

The gap in labor force participation between working-age whites and people of color is also on the decline. This is due to a slight decline in the white participation rate and slight increase in the rate of people of color. Whites went from 67.2% participation in 2005 to 65.4% in 2017. People of color went from 61.6% to 62.4% in 2017.
