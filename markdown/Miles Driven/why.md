Daily miles driven per capita, and vehicle miles traveled (VMT), is an indicator of travel demand on roads. Decreasing VMT growth is a goal in the Connections 2045 Plan. Increased VMT can indicate that the region has increased needs for infrastructure investment and transportation is causing more negative environmental impacts. Environmental impacts include stormwater runoff from roads; air, water, and noise pollution; greenhouse gas emissions; habitat fragmentation; and barriers to wildlife movement. A downward trend in per capita VMT can indicate a slower economy (i.e., household funds are constrained so fewer discretionary trips are made), a change in travel mode preference (i.e., populations are increasingly opting for more space-efficient and environmentally friendly non-auto travel modes), other travel behavior (more carpooling, combining trips, or working from home), or a decline in population.
