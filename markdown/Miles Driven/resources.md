DVRPC’s [Corridor Planning](https://www.dvrpc.org/Corridors/) focuses on multimodal transportation improvements in communities throughout the region, consistent with the long-range plan. [Bicycle](https://www.dvrpc.org/Transportation/Bicycle/), [pedestrian](https://www.dvrpc.org/Transportation/Pedestrian/), and [transit](https://www.dvrpc.org/Transit/) planning efforts focus on providing travel options within the region. [Freight planning](https://www.dvrpc.org/Freight/) is essential for keeping the region’s economy moving. [Transportation System Management and Operations](https://www.dvrpc.org/Transportation/TSMO/) is critical to optimizing the performance of the existing transportation network.
