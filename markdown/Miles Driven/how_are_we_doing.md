Total daily vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the region peaked at 113.38 million in 2007. VMT declined with the Great Recession, but gained ground from 2012 to 2019, as the economy improved. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused a significant one-year drop in miles driven (-18% from 2019 to 2020). This was immediately followed by the most significant one-year gain since 2000 that brought the region back to pre-pandemic levels (+20% by 2021). This growth leveled off slightly in 2022, with a 4% decrease between 2021 and 2022.

Over this time, the daily VMT per capita—a better way to conceptualize individuals’ driving habits—has decreased as well. Current daily VMT (18.02) is a full mile lower per person than in 2000 (19.28) and 2.4 miles less than the per capita VMT peak in 2006 (20.42). Due to the rise in more households and more vehicles per household, per vehicle VMT has seen more steady declines. Daily VMT per vehicle went from 34.5 in 2000 to 28.3 in 2022. This decline in VMT has occurred despite a significant rise in the number of vehicles in the region over this period. In 2022, there were 730,000 more personal vehicles available to the region’s households than in 2000, a 24 percent increase. Per capita vehicle ownership also increased 14 percent over this period, from 0.56 cars per person to 0.64.

New Jersey Counties, led by Burlington (28.5 daily miles per capita) and Gloucester (27.7 daily miles per capita), have the highest per capita VMT. As the least auto-dependent part of the region, Philadelphia has the lowest per capita daily VMT at 9.8 miles per person. Philadelphia residents also have the lowest car ownership rate, with just under one vehicle for every two people. Bucks, Chester, Gloucester, and Montgomery counties all have more than 0.7 vehicles per person. The highest growth in personal vehicle ownership on a per capita basis between 2000 and 2022 has occurred in the City of Philadelphia.
