Total daily vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the region peaked at 113.38 million in 2007. VMT declined with the Great Recession, but gained ground from 2012 to 2019, as the economy improved. The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 caused the most significant one-year drop in miles driven (-18% from 2019 to 2020), but was followed by the most significant one-year gain since 2000 that brought the region back to pre-pandemic levels (+20% by 2021).

Still, over this time the daily VMT per capita—a better way to conceptualize individuals’ driving habits—has decreased. Even after the VMT rebound in 2021, current daily VMT (18.77) is a half mile lower per person than in 2000 (19.28) and 1.65 miles less than the per capita VMT peak in 2006 (20.42). Due to the rise in more households and more vehicles per household, per vehicle VMT has seen more steady declines. Daily VMT per vehicle went from 34.45 to 29.62.

New Jersey Counties, led by Burlington (28.35 daily miles per capita) and Gloucester (27.08 daily miles per capita), have the highest per capita VMT. As the least auto-dependent part of the region, Philadelphia has the lowest per capita daily VMT at 10.26 miles per person.
