An equitable, inclusive region means everyone has the opportunity to participate and thrive. But the history of racial and ethnic discrimination in both the country and the region has held generations of residents back from accessing the same opportunitiesâ€”particularly in the areas of income and employment. Neighborhoods with higher concentrations of people of color are more often the locations of poor housing stock, poorly performing schools, worse air quality, higher rates of crime, and reduced transportation safety.

There are wonderful things that occur in neighborhoods that share common cultures; nevertheless, diversity has been shown to improve quality of life for everyone. A less segregated region, with higher incomes and workforce inclusion for people of color, improves the bottom line for all businesses and the lives of all citizens.
