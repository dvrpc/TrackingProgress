Initial declarations of merchandise export values are reported at the metropolitan and county levels by the [International Trade Administration](https://legacy.trade.gov/mas/ian/metroreport/tg_ian_002825.asp) using data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Origin of Movement–ZIP code Based Series. This represents the exports of goods. Services exports are not included in this dataset.

Goods exports data reported at the subnational level relies on initial declarations and does not get updated with subsequent revisions found in national data. Export county is assigned using the address of the United States Principal Party in Interest of record—which is often, but not always, the entity producing the merchandise.

A small portion of the overall metropolitan Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) export value does not have a county determination. DVRPC assigned this residual CBSA value to counties according to the portion of the CBSA's export value attributable to each county. Values were then adjusted by consumer price index factors to 2017 dollars. Despite inherent errors, this data is a relevant gauge of where the region stands based off previous years. Merchandise export data by county is available starting in 2012.
