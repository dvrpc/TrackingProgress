The value of merchandise exports from the region was over $18.2 billion in 2018, a drop of 8.9% since 2012. These exports were steady from 2012 through 2014, followed by a decline to about $16.5 billion in 2016. 2017 showed an uptick, over 2016, and 2018 continued this trend with a gain of $1.062 billion. The total regional exports have recovered some value from previous decreases but remain below the 2013 peak of almost $21.06 billion.

With exports valued at over $4.2 billion in 2018, Montgomery County has led the region in export activity every year since 2012. All of the Pennsylvania suburban counties experienced moderate export growth from 2017 to 2018. Philadelphia experienced a small contraction in exports between 2017 and 2018. In the New Jersey portion of the region, Gloucester County continued to be the largest merchandise exporter with 2018 exports totaling $2.135 billion.

Merchandise export data at the industry level is not available for county-level analysis. However, metropolitan statistical area (MSA)-level statistics reveal patterns that are likely contributing to the trends seen in DVRPC counties. The leading industries for merchandise export at MSA level are related to pharmaceutical, basic chemical, and resin manufacturing (North American Industry Classification System 3254, 3251, and 3252). Pharmaceutical exports have dropped since 2014 and show only a moderate recovery in 2018. Additionally, petroleum manufacturing exports have been in a steady decline since 2014. Supplementing these losses are growing exports from industries, including plastics manufacturing and medical equipment and supplies manufacturing, as well as a rebound in aerospace product and parts manufacturing.
