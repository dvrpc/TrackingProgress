In 2022, 29.5% of all pavement segment miles throughout the region were in poor condition. Poor condition pavement for the entire region declined by nearly 10% from its 2014 peak of 39.2%, and is now 0.7% below the 2010 base year of 30.2%. DVRPC is working with both state departments of transportation to advance the right treatment at the right time to better align the region’s resources with the considerable maintenance needs of our aging roadway network.

When looking just at Pennsylvania counties, poor condition pavement increased from 25.5% to 33.0% over the same period, from 2010 to 2022. In 2022, 1,360.8 Pennsylvania segment miles were in poor condition; a 27.3% increase from 2010. A contributing factor in pavement decline in this subregion is the shifting of financial resources to reduce the backlog of structurally deficient bridges. Despite the poor numbers over the eleven-year period, conditions have been steadily improving in Pennsylvania since 2015, when poor pavement conditions peaked at 36.8% of all lane miles. The positive trend began with the passage of Act 89, which generated additional revenue for transportation improvements throughout the Commonwealth.

In New Jersey, counties’ poor condition pavement dropped from 41.6% of segment miles to 21.3% between 2010 to 2022. Asset management practices in the state subregion have focused on improving pavement condition. The subregion succeeded in increasing the amount of segment miles listed in good condition by 94.5%. New Jersey benefits from a newer transportation network compared with Pennsylvania, and has not yet faced the same end-of-useful-life challenges for much of its infrastructure.

Most counties track fairly closely with others in their state. In Philadelphia, however, poor conditions were experienced on half or more of pavement segment-miles between 2017 and 2022.
