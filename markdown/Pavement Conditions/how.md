Although the region continues to prioritize asset management with a fix-it-first strategy, pavement condition continues to fight an uphill battle against aging. Between 2010 and 2017, the number of segment miles listed in poor condition increased by 5.3%.

Pennsylvania roadways account for much of the deficient pavement in the region, with 364.3 segment miles falling into poor condition (a 25.5% increase between 2010 and 2017). Shifting financial resources to reduce the backlog of structurally deficient bridges is a contributing factor in pavement decline in this subregion. Despite the poor numbers over the seven-year period, conditions have steadily improved in Pennsylvania since 2014, when poor pavement conditions peaked at 39.4% of all lane miles. This improvement came following the passage of Act 89, which generated additional revenue for transportation improvements throughout the Commonwealth.

In New Jersey, asset management practices have focused on improving pavement condition, and ratings have steadily improved. Between 2010 and 2017, the subregion succeeded in increasing the amount of segment miles listed in Good condition by 16%. New Jersey benefits from a newer transportation network compared to Pennsylvania, has not yet faced the same end-of-useful-life challenges for much of its infrastructure.
