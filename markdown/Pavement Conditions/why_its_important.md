The region's roadways enable mobility and commerce throughout the region. Pavement in poor condition slows down traffic and can cause unnecessary vehicle damage, which increases congestion and the cost of driving. Nearly all goods movement is completed by truck for some portion of the trip. The cost of shipping is passed on to consumers when they pay for goods and services. Therefore, how well we maintain the road network also has an impact on how much we pay for the everyday products and services we need or want. Savings generated by good road conditions have a positive impact on our economy.

Roads can be kept in good condition with proper maintenance for a much lower cost than reconstructing a road that has fallen into a state of disrepair. Regular resurfacing and preservation help to maintain good pavement condition. This ensures that our roads are smooth and safe for operation. Typically, a road is resurfaced every 12 to 15 years, although a high-traffic volume interstate may be resurfaced every seven years, while a lower-volume collector road may be resurfaced only every 25 years.

This indicator reflects the _Connections 2050_ Plan goal to rebuild and modernize the regionâ€™s transportation assets in order to achieve and maintain a state-of-good repair.
