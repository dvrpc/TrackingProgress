Both the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) track pavement conditions as required by federal regulations for state-maintained and National Highway System (NHS) roadways. NJDOT and PennDOT maintain data on the condition of all federal- and state-owned roadways. 

It is important to note that _segment miles_ are used in the pavement conditions graphs, as both states provide data to calculate this metric. Segment miles measure the roadway length. Length is doubled for divided facilities. Unlike _lane miles which _fully account for pavement width, segment miles will not overrepresent narrower roads, with fewer lanes. Wider interstates, with more lanes, will be somewhat underrepresented for total pavement area.

States and the Federal Highway Administration use a number of different methodologies for classifying pavement conditions. One measure of road condition is the _International Roughness Index (IRI)_. The IRI determines pavement roughness conditions based on total inches of surface variation per mile. IRI is one of the pavement condition measurements that PennDOT uses. New Jersey integrates two condition measures, IRI and _Surface Distress Index (SDI)_, into its condition ratings. SDI is a measure from a visual inspection of the size of cracks, holes, and ruts in a roadway. Therefore, when segment miles or percentage of segment miles are added up for the region, note that these are aggregations combining two different classification methods.

The first chart displays the percentage of pavement in deficient condition for the region and its counties. Explore the data further by specifying a road type in the drop-down menu. The second chart shows each condition type in total segment miles with options to specify region or subregion and road type. Note that county-level statistics for Pennsylvania were only available from 2017 onward.
