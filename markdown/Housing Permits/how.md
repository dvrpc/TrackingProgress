1999 marked the year with the greatest proportion of residential building permit approvals in the region’s Growing Suburbs and rural Areas. The proportion of building permits issued in Core Cities and Development Communities in 2021 has increased from the 1999 low by 51.5% to 85.3% of all permits issued. From 2012 to 2020 the annual percentage of residential building permits being approved in Core Cities and Developed Communities has been between 60 and 70% of all approvals—levels not seen since the early 1980s. The one-year jump to 85.3% of approvals in smart growth areas of the region was an anomaly caused by the expiration of the City of Philadelphia’s tax abatement incentives, and multitudes of builders seeking permit approvals while they still qualified for the abatements.

The Since Base Year value type option in the dropdown menu shows units approved since 1980. Since reaching a low point of 46.1% of permits issued in Core Cities and Developed Communities in 2003, just before the 2021 anomaly year, permitting rates in these areas surpassed 50% for the first time in 2020. Despite the increase in the rate of permits issued in more recent years in Core Cities and Developed Communities, the cumulative effect of prior development preferences has been hard to overcome. That is due in part to the declining number of total permits and the legacy of permits issued in Growing Suburbs and Rural areas in the earlier decades of this dataset.

Total permits approved are seen in Charts 2 and 3. Further emphasizing the anomaly that was 2021, there were 6,000 more approvals in 2021 than the prior peak approval year of 1986, and Philadelphia along surpassed the regional count of approvals for all but 2 years in the mid-80s. 2021 was the first year since the Great Recession on par with the housing bubble years of the early 2000s.

2021 aside, chart 3 shows a waning interest in single-family development that dominated small and large multifamily development structures until more recent years. By 2019 and 2020 multifamily approvals were between 55 and 60% of all approvals. Still, the cumulative effects of decades of single-family preference means that more than 71% of units approved from 1980 to 2021 were single family.
