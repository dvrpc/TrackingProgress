Residential construction permit approvals can indicate the health of the region's real estate sector and general desirability; where that construction occurs can also indicate if the region is growing in a sustainable manner. The Long-Range Plan promotes growth in areas appropriate for development—including more than 130 Plan Centers along with Core Cities and Developed Community Planning Areas—where transportation and utility infrastructure can support new development and won't come at the expense of natural habitats and resources. Since Plan Centers do not always align with Census geographies, they cannot be tracked for permit activity.
