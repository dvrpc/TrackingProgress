Chart 1 shows the trendline for percent (or share) of units approved via building permits that are located in the region’s Core Cities and Developed Communities. Since the lowest point 1999, the percentage increased by 30.7% to 64.5% of all units approved in 2023. The year 2012 marked a turning point at which Core Cities and Developed Communities have been the location for at least 60% of all approvals, matching levels from the early 1980s. The one year jump in 2021 to 85.3% of approvals was an anomaly, caused by the expiration of the City of Philadelphia’s tax abatement incentives. In this year, many builders rushed to get permit approvals while they still qualified for the abatements.

Chart 2 shows total units approved by Planning Area. Generally, the number of housing units approved in all Planning Areas declined from the mid-1980s to the Great Recession, but then started increasing to 2021, which saw a major spike. Numbers have been declining since then. Further emphasizing the 2021 anomaly, there were 6,000 more approvals in this year than the prior peak in 1986; Philadelphia, alone, surpassed the regional count of approvals for 41 of the prior 43 years.

Chart 3 shows total units approved by type of unit. It illustrates a shift to more small and large multifamily development in recent years. By 2019 and 2020, multifamily approvals were between 55% and 60% of all unit approvals. Still, single-family units represent 70.5% of units approved from 1980 to 2023. Excluding the 2021 anomaly, multifamily unit approvals dropped to 47% in 2023 from their highs in 2019 and 2020.

The “Since Base Year” option in the dropdown menu for all three charts presents the cumulative units approved since 1980. Since the low point of 46.1% of units approved in Core Cities and Developed Communities in 2003 (See Chart 1), approval rates in these Planning Areas surpassed 50% for the first time in 2020. Despite the increase in the rate of units approved in these areas in more recent years, the cumulative effect of prior development preferences during the housing boom of the 1980s and ‘90s has been difficult to overcome.
