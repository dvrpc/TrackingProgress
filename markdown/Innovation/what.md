Utility patents are patents covering the creation of or improvements to machines, processes, or products. Location data for utility patents has been provided by the U.S. Patent Office, dating back to 1998, but is limited to the residential address of the first named author. If a resident of the region is not named first on a patent with a first named author residing outside the region, that patent will not be allocated in Greater Philadelphiaâ€”even if it is relevant to innovation in the region. Street addresses are not provided, only mailing address, city, and state, making precise patent holder location identification more difficult.
