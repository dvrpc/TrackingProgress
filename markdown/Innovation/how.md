Between 1998 and 2017, patent approvals attributed to the region had grown by 28.7%. Patent approvals were at a near peak in 2017, with 2,707 approvalsâ€”just 20 fewer than in 2014. After a dip to 1,373 approvals in 2005, approvals made their way back to the late 1990s and early 2000s levels in 2010 and have remained above 2,200 since 2012.

Comparable data for the same span of years is not available, but from 2000 to 2015, national growth in utility patents grew by 65.6%. While Greater Philadelphia residents contributed to an unknown portion of those patents even if their names did not appear first, the region's first named author patents only grew by 18.8% during the same period. Relative to the entire state of New Jersey or Pennsylvania, however, Greater Philadelphia's patent growth has been more favorable. From 2000 to 2017, patents in the DVRPC region grew by 27.3% while statewide New Jersey and Pennsylvania grew by only 16.4 and 16.5%, respectively.
