The _Connections 2050_ Long-Range Plan seeks to “foster racially and socioeconomically integrated neighborhoods, and advance [environmental justice] for all the region’s inhabitants.” There are wonderful things that occur in neighborhoods that share common cultures; nevertheless, diversity has been shown to improve quality of life for everyone. When neighborhoods diversify in income levels, significant gains are seen in essential resources like public education, parks and open space, and infrastructure; and children see new opportunities that they might not have if they were growing up in more income-segregated spaces.
