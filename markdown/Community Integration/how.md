Racial and ethnic segregation among neighborhoods in the region is on the decline. Comparing the concentrations of people of color and Latinx versus white, non-Latinx in each tract relative to the region's overall racial and ethnic makeup, neighborhoods are slowly diversifying. Although theoretical, in 1990, 68.6% of the region's population would have needed to relocate in order to evenly distribute people of color throughout the region. By 2021, the percentage dropped to 52.5. This value still reflects a region where a high percentage of neighborhoods comprise persons of the same race and ethnicity. Over a 30 year period, racial and ethnic integration only improved half a percentage per year, and still more than half the population would need to move to see neighborhoods that were as racially and ethnically diverse as the region.

Income segregation in the region has been stagnant for the last three decades. The 1990 Income Segregation Index value of 41.1% in 2021 is identical to the 1990 value. In other words, theoretically, 41% of the region's population would have to relocate in order to see an even distribution of low-income households throughout the region. 

Taken together, the high racial and ethnic segregation and immobile income segregation show a region far from its goal of seeing racially and socioeconomically integrated neighborhoods.
