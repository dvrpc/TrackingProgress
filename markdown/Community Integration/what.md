Both charts use a statistical method called a dissimilarity index to quantify how segregated the region is among its census tracts, first by race and ethnicity, then by income. The indices use decennial census tract data for 1990 and 2000. The ACS five-year period estimates for subsequent tract analysis, reporting the final year of the period as the data year (e.g., 2021 is a period estimate for 2017â€“2021, based on households surveyed in those years).

The Racial/Ethnic Segregation Index in the first chart is an indicator of how segregated the region's census tracts are, relative to the regional distribution of white, non-Latinx population and people of color and Latinx population. In a given year, it shows how dissimilar the racial and ethnic makeup of tracts across the region are to each other and demonstrates the percentage of the population that would theoretically need to relocate in order to match the region's racial and ethnic makeup. The higher the index value the less integrated white, non-latinx populations are with other races and ethnicities.

The Income Segregation Index in the second chart is an indicator of how segregated the region's census tracts are, relative to the regional distribution of low-income households versus the rest. Low-income is defined as households below 200% of the federal poverty rate. It shows how dissimilar the income makeups of census tracts across the region are to each other for each year displayed and demonstrates what percentage of the population would need to relocate in order to match the regional income distribution. The higher the index value the more geographic concentrations of wealth or poverty exist in the region.
