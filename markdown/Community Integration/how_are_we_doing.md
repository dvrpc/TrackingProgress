Over a 32-year period, racial and ethnic integration declined by half a percent per year; while income segregation has effectively remained the same. 

Although progress has been made in reducing racial and ethnic segregation, much more work is needed to achieve the vision of a diverse, integrated region. Comparing the concentrations of Latinx and people of color versus white, non-Latinx populations in each tract relative to the region's overall racial and ethnic makeup, neighborhoods are slowly diversifying. In 1990, 68.6% of the region's population would have, theoretically, needed to move to another census tract in order to have equally diverse neighborhoods throughout the region. By 2022, that dropped to 51.8%. This still reflects a region with many racially and ethnically segregated neighborhoods.

Income segregation in the region has been consistent for the last three decades. The  Income Segregation Index value of 41.0% in 2022 is almost exactly the same as it was in 1990. In both years, about 41% of the region's population would have to relocate in order to see an even distribution of low-income households throughout the region.
