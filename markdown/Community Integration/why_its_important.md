The _Connections 2050_ Long-Range Plan seeks to foster racially and socioeconomically integrated neighborhoods, and advance environmental justice for all the region’s inhabitants. While there are benefits to neighborhoods that share common cultures—such as high social cohesion within the community—diversity has been shown to improve quality of life for everyone. When neighborhoods diversify in income levels, significant gains are seen in essential resources like public education, green space, and infrastructure, and children are provided opportunities they might not have if they were growing up in more income-segregated spaces.
