            <p>Ground-level ozone and fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>)--particles have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers and can penetrate the human lung and potentially the circulatory system.  Both these pollutants can cause respiratory problems in even healthy people, but are especially a concern for sensitive populations, such as people already suffering from asthma, children, and the elderly. Air pollution has been shown to have disproportionate effects on persons of color and low income populations. In addition to higher costs for households and the healthcare system, its economic implications include more days of missed work and school.</p>

            <p>The DVPRC region currently does not meet federal air quality standards for these two pollutants Because the region does not meet federal air quality standards, the Clean Air Act requires DVRPC to show that regional transportation projects will not harm air quality.</p>
            <p>To compare the potential harm of different pollutants on the same scale, the EPA creates an Air Quality Index (AQI) for each pollutant that ranges from 0 to 500. Air quality can be classified into six different categories based on AQI: Good (0 to 50), Moderate (51 to 100), Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (101 to 150), Unhealthy (151 to 200), Very Unhealthy (201 to 300), and Hazardous (301 to 500). To determine if a particular day violates the EPA air quality standards, the AQI for each monitored pollutant is calculated and the highest value across all monitored pollutants is taken. If that value is greater than 100, a violating day has occurred.</p>
            <p>The first chart shows the number of days violating air quality standards per year since 1980, along with a five year rolling average, based on the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington core based statistical area.</p>
            <p>The second chart shows the number of days per year in each violating category (Unhealthy for Sensitive Populations, Unhealthy, Very Unhealthy, and Hazardous) for both Ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Toggling between ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub> data, ozone data are available dating back to 1980, while PM<sub>2.5</sub> data are only available from the fourth quarter of 1998. Neither pollutant reached hazardous levels in the region during the available data period. Both ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels are generally higher during the summer months, when weather conditions are conducive to ozone formation and local accumulation of PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution, although elevated levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> have also occurred in the winter months.</p>

            <p>The latest air quality data from the Environmental Protection Agency shows the region continuing its reduction of ozone and fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) pollutants. Days violating National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and the severity of those days have declined steadily over the past five years. As seen in the first chart, since 2014, the region has averaged just 22 violating days per year. Although air quality is greatly influenced by weather conditions, long-term trends show a dramatic decrease in violating days over the last two decades.</p>
            <p>The second chart below shows that concentrations of both pollutants are decreasing in severity. For ozone, the last Very Unhealthy day occurred in 2007, and for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, it was 2008. But ozone tends to violate air quality standards more frequently than PM<sub>2.5</sub>.</p>
            <p>The dramatic declines in unhealthy air quality days of the past few decades show the impact federal emissions standards have had, along with greater public awareness of pollutants and ways to lessen their impact.
